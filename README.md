# The 4K Upscaling Playbook: An Interactive Guide

This repository contains the source code for an interactive, single-page web application that serves as a step-by-step guide for upscaling AI-generated video. It details a complete workflow, from preparing the source file in **CapCut** to a multi-phase process for creating a pristine 4K/60fps final product using **Topaz Video AI**.

## ‚ú® About The Guide

The goal of this project is to demystify the complex process of "AI-on-AI" enhancement. It breaks down the workflow into clear, manageable phases:

1. **CapCut Prep:** Optimal export settings to create a high-quality source file.
2. **Phase 1: Refine & Interpolate:** Gently cleaning the 1080p source and converting from 30fps to 60fps in Topaz Video AI.
3. **Phase 2: Upscale to 1440p:** The first upscaling step with targeted model comparisons.
4. **Phase 3: Final 4K Polish:** The final upscale to 4K, focusing on sharpness vs. natural texture.
5. **Artifact Control:** Tips for managing common issues when upscaling AI video.
6. **Final Export:** Recommended settings for a high-quality 4K deliverable.

The guide uses interactive charts to help visualize the trade-offs between different AI models and strategies, making the decision-making process more intuitive.
